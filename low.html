                        <p class="text-xsmall">Yes, the Starbucks Card is an acceptable form of payment at our stores. However, we may temporarily be unable to perform most Starbucks Card transactions due to unavoidable technical problem or unforeseen network downtime. 
<br>
<br>When the network is down, Starbucks Card customers can still earn Stars on eligible purchases even if they pay using other forms of payment (cash, debit/credit card, eWallet). The transaction will be similar to a regular purchase using cash, debit/credit card or eWallet but will require our barista to scan your Starbucks Card to capture your account's information. The balance on your Starbucks Card will not be deducted. A purchase receipt will be issued with details of your Card as proof of an offline Starbucks Card transaction.</p>

If you have multiple cards under your account, you can still use the remaining cards for purchase. You also have the option to transfer the balance of the lost/stolen card to one of your other cards registered under the same account.</p>

                        <p class="text-xsmall">When connectivity is down in stores, we are temporarily unable to perform all Starbucks Card transactions. To serve you better at times of downtime, we will allow you to earn Stars on your purchase even if you pay using other forms of payment (cash, credit/debit card, eWallet).

<br>We can capture your Starbucks Card information even when we are offline and credit Stars to your account for eligible purchases. The balance on your Starbucks Card will not be deducted.</p>

                        <p class="text-xsmall">Our barista should first attempt to process your purchase using your Starbucks Card. If the system is down, you will be asked if you would like to proceed with your purchase using other forms of payment (cash, credit/debit card, eWallet). The transaction will be similar to a purchase using cash, credit/debit card or eWallet, but will require our barista to scan your Starbucks Card at the register to capture your account's information. You will be issued a receipt for your purchase with details of your Starbucks Card.</p>

<br>
<br>1. Go to the Food tile on the Grab app and search for Starbucks to order.
<br>2. Once you’ve completed your order, go to the ‘Loyalty and Membership’ section on the Order Summary page. Click ‘Add Account’ and type in your Starbucks Rewards log-in details.
<br>3. Once you’ve received a notification that you’ve successfully linked your accounts, you will start collecting Stars on all paid and completed GrabFood deliveries. There’s no need to link accounts every time you order Starbucks on GrabFood after.</p>
